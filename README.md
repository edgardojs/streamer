# Tweepy Bot
## Sample functions for construction a twitter bot. 
This twitter bot contains a set of functions that can manipulate objects in the tweepy module. 

The idea is to eventually develop a twitter bot that would run through a cron job.
Some of the functions like delete_batch can be handy if you want to delete multiple statuses at once.
